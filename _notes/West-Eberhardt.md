- the "causal chain of evolutionary change."
- *issue:* "phenotype" is a loosely defined, completely simplified term poorly branching together a much more highly complex, bi-directional relationship to explain organism behavior, ect.

**Glossary:**

**Adaptive novelty**: a new structure or property of an organism that allows it to perform a new function, thus opening a new "adaptive zone"
**- development**
**- developmental plasticity**:
**Canalization**: measure of the ability of a population to produce the same phenotype regardless of variability of its environment or genotype, "biological robustness"
- ex: high canalization--motor development, everyone walks
- ex: not- canalized: intelligence
**De-canalization**: the variability of a trait at the population level increases after some perturbation, (mean val for quant. trait could be unchanged, while variance increases)
- **adaptive developmental plasticity**:
- **proximate mechanism**
- **ultimate mechanism**
- **quantitative trait**: measurable phenotype that depends on the cumulative actions of many genes and the environment.
	- ex: height, weight, blood pressure
- **morphology**: deals with the form of living things
- **modifier alleles**: affect the phenotypic and/or molecular expression of other genes
- **sociobiology**: scientific study of the biological aspects of how organisms interact
- **Darwin's gradualism**: accumulation of quantitative changes leads to qualitative change
- **"underlying synapomorphy**"  (shared developmental potential due to common ancestry
- **piecemeal synthesis**: characterized by unsystematic, partial measures taken over a period of time.
- **heterochrony**: change to the timing or rate of development relative to the ancestors
	- e.g. large brain (paramorphic), shrunken jaw (paedomorphic)
	- example of phenotypic plasticity
- **ontogeny**: development from gamete cell through full maturation
- **developmental diversity in a sentence about ants**:  Ontogeny needs to be appreciated in particular when distinct developmental pathways lead to irreversible morphological divergence between breeders and helpers.
- **Kin selection** is the evolutionary strategy that favours the reproductive success of an organism's relatives, even at a cost to the organism's own survival and reproduction. 
	- **Kin altruism ** can look like altruistic behaviour whose evolution is driven by kin selection
- **neo-darwinism** generally described the integration of CD natural selection  with Mendelian genetics
- **continuous variation**: predictable
- **discontinuous variation**: unpredictable as per mutation, or influenced by the environment (dev plasticity)
- **heuristic value**: capacity to be used for problem-solving 
- **polygene**:
- **disruptive selection**: Disruptive selection, also called diversifying selection, describes changes in population genetics in which extreme values for a trait are favored over intermediate values. In this case, the variance of the trait increases and the population is divided into two distinct groups.

*Need to clarify:*
- meaning of this sentence: n. Evolution is often portrayed as a gradual shift in the
dimensions of quantitative traits, yet biologists wish to explain the origin and spread of the discrete and genetically complex entities we call traits."

- actual mechanism by which genes are expressed
- What are the "developmental causes of variation?"(5)
- discrete (qualitatively different) novelties.? (6) these are not accounted for by genetic shift accounts of evo
- Clarify: "Given  so  many genome-altering phenomena that may  go  on with  no exposure to selection, it is easy  to  understand  why  molecular  biologists  iden-tify  selection  with  lack  of change (due  to its  allele-conserving effects), whereas evolutionary biologists identify  selection  with  change  (because  they  con-sider  only  expressed  DNA  and  not  the  less  stable portions of the genome  where  a  multitude of pro-cesses  cause  and preserve  uncorrected  change)"p19

*Questions for Chris*
- mushrooms that can navigate? learning that occurs as a unit? learning that occurs in "supraorganisms"?
- 


*Thoughts:*
- "The conceptual gap  that should  be  filled  by  development  has  been  filled  instead  with  metaphors,  such  as  genetic  programming,  blueprints for organisms, and gene-environment interaction." 
	- desire to fill these conceptual gaps with simple, predictable information is a clear theme in science. 
		- e.g. overestimation of the influence of selection and underestimation of the influence of RANDOMNESS, UNCERTAINTY, UNPREDICTABILITY
			- Judeo-christian religion fed us the idea that we are god's perfect children individually designed by him. This attachment to selection and genetic blue-print mentality is reflects this as well.
				- everything is a fucking mistake, mistakes are a social concept, you're just fucking alive, can you just fucking be alive?
- (4) systemic aversion to the implications of adaptive flexibility (in all living things)--
	- - again, we want to be pre-destined, with a purpose, a function, in order to be valued, and have meaning. 

Impact of the technological revolution: we think of everything in-terms of a machine. We created machines, out of nature. We, nature, created systems which reflect the ordered side of the polarity of nature, forgetting that this is only part of the story, true living things, intelligent, conscious things are constantly dancing on the in breath of order, and the out breath of chaos. It is a mistake to think only one half can replicate the whole. 

*when we are desperately seeking to prove the theory of evolution, what (axioms) do we take for granted?*
- what are we really desperate for? we should keep Longino in mind when asking these questions: what values are the lens we are evaluating this through?
	- what if that lens prevents us from seeing "truth?" do we even want truth?
		- or seeking validation, (Hoff: logic=to convince others, not to seek truth)
			- Hoff: we are evolutionarily designed NOT to perceive "truth, or O.R."

thought: newtonian causation, machine-model. bottom-up cause and effect. one directional. Anthropocentric.
		1) Imagine if we modeled these after nature. top-down and bottom-up. Infintiely directional causality. RELATIONSHIP, CONNECTION, as the most intinsically real and powerful, not the entities themselves. 

***thoughts that ended up being connections to neuroscience oops***
IN-TERMS OF: **heterochrony**: change to the timing or rate of development relative to the ancestors
	- e.g. large brain (paramorphic), shrunken jaw (paedomorphic)
	- example of phenotypic plasticity
- has anyone researched what environmental conditions were pervasive at the time that the HARS genes 
[Rewiring of human neurodevelopmental gene regulatory programs by human accelerated regions](https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S0896627321005808?token=CCB79DFC7F7EAF978B49F650F18DEC0702DE5FC7878A3323895E9E97FD16F2D805810670A47EF51688EB63AAA28F0723&originRegion=us-east-1&originCreation=20211001021925)
- Rapid change of HARS genes at a point in time is connected with the heterochrony also in phenotypic expression of the key factors that seem to separate us from our chimp relatives.. Could identifying the environmental factors that made the (predecessors to the phenotypic manifestation of) what makes us human selected for in our genome, and help us identify why we are the way we are/why consciousness evolved to this level of awareness in humans?
*Evolution of  species from stasis to realizing it is s constantly active war, reminds me of similar paradigm shift in brain science (neurons always active and updating.*

***what if the "goal" of evolution is not dominance, 'survival, persistence, and take-over of the fittest', but Diversity, Synergy. "Entropy" in the way that ultimate equanimity and order looks like disorder from inside an unequal system***


- "The  unimodal adaptation  concept  shows the power of an internally consistent set of ideas  to re-inforce  a  single  line  of  thought,  even  when  this means  overlooking  a  large  body  of contradictory facts.(7)"
	- damn haha
"Given this  background,  it is  not surprising  that it  took a frequency-dependent equilibrium theory of "evolu-tionary stable strategies"  to convince  evolutionists that more  than one complex behavior could  coex-ist  within  a  population. "(8) 
- hah

"Another consequence of the genetic definition  is the  idea  that  environmentally  mediated  change  is trivial  for  evolution"(18).
- general theme of assuming that humans are a separate, contained system from the environment, which just "does its own thing, and is a nuisance,"rather than understanding that this environment **literally created US. we were not plopped down here to fuck around.** we are no less "created by" the environment today, as we were billions of years ago.


*Summary: *
KEY ARGUMENT: The flexible phenotype is both the product of evolution, and the target of selection. 
- implications of this theoretical incorporation of developmental plasticity calls for re-thinking of lots of major questions in evolutionary biology
Issue where we explain away a gap between the genetic theory of the origin and spread of traits, and the manifest phenotypes. 
- How are complex, adaptively flexible traits constructed during evolution *if genes are a direct blueprint to behavior?*
	- it was previously thought behavior adapted through "the accumulation of modifier alleles, selected gradually and independently, one by one(3)"
*sociobiology*, Intuitively, we know human behavior is circumstantial (influenced by environment and upbringing, ect.)

KEY PROBLEM: If recurrent phenotypes are as much a product of recurrent circumstances as they are replicated genes, how can we accept a theory of organic evolution that deals primarily with genes?

*Why the historical emphasis on genetics?*
Genetics have provided the most progress toward a current theory of evolution
- early progress on genetics required erasing of development from discussions of heredity.
	- avoid Lamarkian errors 
- Environmental sensitivity became considered noise 
	- ex: taxonomy: if variation isn't merely genetic, species character is much less reliable.
		- occasionally, the capacity to produce a certain phenotype can be considered a trait (underlying synapomorphy)

Due to the history of evo-devo bio, we have a thorough understanding of how genes affect, and a poor understanding of how the environment influences evolution (through its effects on development (environment selects for the expression of certain phenotypes,) and of the developmental causes of variation). 

*Six Points of Confusion and Controversy*
1) The  Unimodal Adaptation Concept  and  the  Multimodal Products  of Development and  Plasticity
	1.  the ability  of organisms  to  facultatively  switch  among specializations, producing polymorphisms, poly-phenisms,  and  different  behavioral  and  morpho-logical  modes;
	2.   the common  occurrence  of distinctive life-stage variants during ontogeny, with larvae, juveniles, and adults commonly having very different adaptive  morphologies and  behaviors.  
		1. overall unimodal made it harder to reinstate development, as it didn't intrinsically account for developmental differences
			1. **Unimodal ad. concept and the idea of a single premium/primary adaptive state reflected in the idea that competition between alternative alleles should ultimately lead to persistance of only one, because one will ultimately be favored by selection**
				1. deems polymorphism unstable, and ()"unlikely?")
	3. Developmental divergence allows for intraspecific diversity by permitting mosaic evolution in different directions within the same population. (8)

2) The cohesiveness problem: the idea that development is a conservative (homeostatic) force rather than development as the source of all change
1. hardy-weinberg equilibrium: causes of change are mutation from equilibrium
2. all gene expression depends on preexisting phe-notypic  structure and  specific  conditions  as  surely as  upon specific  genes.  The phenotype is  cohesive, but it is  also  eminently  changeable. 

3) Proximate and ultimate causation
	1) distinction was to avoid confusion between different levels of explanation in 
	
	
	
4) Controversy between the relative importance of Continuous Change (and Selection) versus Discrete Variation (development)
	1) "The  unresolved  problem of the  continuous and the discrete  is  hidden  like  a  Freudian  complex  be-neath  many  of  the  long-standing  controversies  of evolutionary biology. l believe that this problem reflects  a deeper one, the unperceived tension between compartmentalization  and  connectedness, subdivision  and  integration in biological  organization itself"(12)
	- solution: evo-devo
***principle of complementarity***
"Modularity is reflected  in  developmen-tal  reorganization  via  the  shuffling  or  recombina-tion of discrete phenotypic parts.  Connectedness is reflected  in  the  accommodation  of change  and  the emergence  of  integration  at  different  levels  of  or-ganization.  Switches,  by  integrating environmental and  genomic  influence,  allow  for  q uantitativc  ge-. netic  fine-tuning  of plasticity  and  gene  expression. The  result  is a theory  of the  phenotype  based  on the  complementariry  of  continuous  and  discrete variation."  

5) Problematic metaphors:
**Type 1**: "Complete-instruction" metaphors for genomes has little resemblance to the "decentralized way that responsive structure is made during ontogeny, with forms and functions depending on their circumstances and uses as they are being formed."
	1) Waddington's epigenetic landscape (not super clear to me)
	2) genetic program: allows input from the environment, but the tules and outcomes are entirely defined by the program, no "learning."
- It does  not take  much  reflection  to  realize  that the  genome  does  not contain  a  complete  set  of instructions  for  development,  or even  "an outline of the  information  needed  to create a  human  being  " (Baltimore,  2001) or any other organism.  
	- humans cannot develop language and communication without other humans, which is a relationship.

**Type 2**: genotype-environemnet interaction, or "genetic variation for plasticity" as a metaphor for development.
	1) What is quantitative genetics missing? *,genes dont interact directly with environment*

6) The genotype-phenotype problem: the contradictions that have arisen due to phrasing of evolutionary explanations solely in-terms of genes, while we're truly endeavoring to explain the phenomena of phenotypes. 
	1) Definition of selection: as 1:  differential  reproduction  or fitness  effects  as-sociated with  phenotypic differences, versus 2: that  selection  acts  on genes or that genotypic differences are required for selection  to  occur. The latter excises ph,environ,devo effects from the "causal chain of evolutionary change."
- **argument for phenotypic concept of evolution**: How does the regulatory system (that is capable of the environmental assessment and adaptive response), or (**condition sensitivity**) necessary to explain adaptive decisions evolve?(17)  
- "We acknowledge development with a  reflexive  nod,  then  proceed  as  if it did  not exist(18)"

**SO, she builds to bring the audience to agree to this claim:**
"...if the  phenotype  is  the  real  stuff of evolution,  why  not take a  hard  look  at the  nature  of the  phenotype  itself  and  see,  what  it  may  reveal about evolution?"(p.18)

***TOWARD A SOLUTION***:
- There is a connection between the neglect of en-vironmental  influence  in  development and the  lack of an  adequate  theory  of biological  organization.
KEY: Natural selection  affects  genes only  if  they  are  expressed-only  if  they  differen-tially  influence  phenotypes. 
- yes the genome mutates to provide chances for new phenotypes to be expressed, but whether or not they are expressed depends on the environment.
	
*Instances where genomic change is not exposed to selection, because it is not expressed in phenotype:*
- - Fruit fly experiments on (p.19) drastic fruit fly genome mutations produce no phenotypic changes
- "junk DNA"(does not encode protein, so its function is not well understood) could evolve at its own rate, independent of the phenotype, sheltered from selection
	- ***we wouldn't have it if it didn't  have a purpose.***
- Clarify: "Given  so  many genome-altering phenomena that may  go  on with  no exposure to selection, it is easy  to  understand  why  molecular  biologists  iden-tify  selection  with  lack  of change (due  to its  allele-conserving effects), whereas evolutionary biologists identify  selection  with  change  (because  they  con-sider  only  expressed  DNA  and  not  the  less  stable portions of the genome  where  a  multitude of pro-cesses  cause  and preserve  uncorrected  change)"

KEY: semantic conflation including both proteins (aspects of phenotype), and genomic DNA (which may or may not be expressed and subject to effects of natural selection) under "molecular evolution"

- Emphasizes that environment is an agent of development, rather than just selection

***THREE MAJOR POINTS***
1. The origin  and  evolution  of adaptive  novelty  do  not await mutation; genes are followers, not leaders in evolution. Environmental induction is a major initiator of adaptive evolutionary change. 
	1. **clarify**: when she says that the environment could be the "origin" of adaptive novelty...(along with or more so than genes), does she mean that environment activates certain genes that express traits that are then also selected for by the environment, but the mutation is still the true origin of the possibility for x to be activited?
	2.   
2. "Second, evolutionary novelties  result  from  the  reorganization  of preex-isting  phenotypes  and  the  incorporation  of envi-ronmental  elements.  Novel  traits  are  not de  novo constructions that depend on a series of genetic mu-tations. "
3. Phen plasticity facilitates evolution by the immediate accommodation and exaggeration of change 

is  undoubtedly the  assessment  and  management  of environmental and  social  contingencies  that has  led  to the  evolu-tion  of situation-appropriate  regulation,  with  the eventual  participation  of the  sophisticated  device we  call  "mind.''(20)
