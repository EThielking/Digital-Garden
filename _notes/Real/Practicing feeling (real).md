Practicing feeling (real)

Thursday Feb 24th. There are bombings. In Ukraine. I feel so connected tothis one. I'm not even there. My loved ones are not even there. I feel guilty for not feeling the burder of where this was happening to others. I'm practicing sitting with the pain and with the heavyness. Letting it weight me down an punture my skin until I leak. Until all of the swelling leaks and leaks. It doesn't matter where it came from, what caused me to fill with water. We're so obsessed with causes cause and effect, Newton, that we forget that the only reason we look for a cause is because we are refusing to feel what is real. 

So I'm sitting in my gilded moment, with all of the guilt and the heavyness of my gold and I am letting myself weep. 

This a campaign against a country of numb. That is how we lose ourselves. By becoming numb. I'm porous. I can let my tears fill me up moist and plump, and I can let the sun dry me out tomorrow, shrivel me dry. And again, and again.
