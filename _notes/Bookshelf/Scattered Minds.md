Book: Scattered Minds: The Origins and Healing of Attention Deficit Disorder
[[Gabor Mate]]

- Parents afraid a label will stereotype their child: not baseless: ADD= "problem student, incapable of normal activity"
	- ***How people use language is quite revealing***
		- "this adult "is ADD": is labeling, identifying the whole person with an area of weakness or impairment. 
			- ***no one should be defined or categorized in terms of a particular problem***

*Chapter 6*
[[genetic fundamentalism]]: Belief that almost every illness and human trait is dictated by heredity, and the inflexible laws of DNA rule the biological world. "scrambling for certainty"[[Uncertainty]]
- Attractive because they are easy to grasp, socially acceptable, and release blame on the individual (****AND AGENCY OF THE INDIVIDUAL**) (48)
	- balm for parental guilt, but redirects attention away from "how a society or culture might erode the health of its members"[[Mental Health as a Systemic Issue]] [[Mental Health and Capitalism]]

Genes: "carry potentials inherent in the cells of a given organism"
- Whether "gene" plans get realized is determined by the environment
- "Few diseases are purely genetic"(most we can say is "strongly genetic")
- [[concordance]]: Degree to which same genetic codes will result in same condition
	- high degree supposed to prove hereditary causality why isn't [[concordance]] 100% in identical twins?
- Adoption: deeply traumatic instability of caregiver for infants
	- missing deep human need in infancy: ***crucial influence for adhd***

[[intrautierine life]]
- [[cortisol directly affects developing nervous system]]
	- adoptive mothers under extreme stress: more likely to develop adhd
- whether a "highly reactive/sensitive"fetus's nervous system becomes "a blessing or a curse"depends on environment.
	- isn't everything both, gray, “No tree, it is said, can grow to heaven unless its roots reach down to hell.”[[Carl Jung]] 

Environmental Cause= environmental resolve (undetermined)
- More agency on the individual
- Depresses and cortisol mother = undeniable correlate with Depressed, ADHD child
- emotional atmosphere is a matter of intangibles
- ***Parents' unconscious attitude towards the child***
	- what or whom on the deepest level the child represents for the parent
		- "the needs the parents may have that they subliminally hope the child will meet"
			- [[“The greatest burden a child must bear is the unlived life of **its parents**.”]][[Carl Jung]]

![[cortisol directly affects developing nervous system^]]

Degrees of sensitivity reflect degrees of feeling. (58)
- hyperreactivity = emotional "allergy"
- Not their "fault," its how they were born
- [[Vagus Nerve]] and hypersensitivity
- "...child's body is a barometer for the stress of the whole family system, symptoms the marking on a minutely calibrated instrument."
- (61)
- "Sensitivity is transmuted into suffering and disorders only when the world us unable to heed the exquisitely tuned physiological and psychic responses of the sensitive individual"(62)

- 1yr following birth human brain continues to grow at the same rate as in the womb
	- [[neural darwininsm]]: neurons most useful to bby's survival in given environment are maintained
		- genetic potential for full brain expression can only be fulfilled in the correct environment
			- ***Idea: device/tech that matched fetus's genes with favorable environment, work that can start in-utero and after?***
	- (67) womb is the mother, mother remains the womb after birth
		- womb life = garden of eden, nothing lacking or worked for
		- (if there is no consciousness)--we're not yet eaten from the tree of knowledge 
	- [[extrauterine life]]=second part of gestation [[exterogestation]]
		- umbilical cord -> breastfeeding

9
- attachment and attunement with primary caregiver are determining factors
- Eyes= visible part of the brain and CNS
	- *my father's eyes would scare me. they were icy blue. I could sense the tension, something was frigid. When the ice first cracked the water leaked out. they turned blood red at the creases. Now they seem much deeper than before, almost like his whole soul decided there was space for him to come home. *
- E- Infants, children, feel, expereince, and respnd to ***TRUTH, EMOTION, NS, energy*** not words, intentions, and actions. those are most abstract and illusory.  (72)
- Attunement: parental respnse to infants emotional state, *emotional sharing*
	- The mother's attunement to infant helps infant emotionally regulate and develop social cues
		- improper attunement=adhd child
			- related to adhd feeling that they are always alone in their emotions and noone will understand

10
- Orbitocortex- si, impulse control, attention, 
- **shift from external regulation to internal**, victim to agent=prefrontal cortex development
- OFC visio-spacial orientation, attention: picks what to focus on from external stimuli, emo significance, relationships of self and other, 
	- delays impulsive primitive emotional flooding response before top-down step-in
	- ***for me it feels like I inhibit from showing that im having the impulsive response, but it is still there. I then know to intellectualize the situation and pick my "best" response, but the physciological and mood effects of the strong emotions are still there?***
	- records and stores emotional effects of experiences
		- early ones form emotional footprint for life interactions
- **People who damage ofc have textbook adhd symptoms**
- Deficiancy in brain chemistry=effect as much as cause
- Dopamine receptors and nerve endings spurred in infants by joy NTs, such as ***but not limited to?*** attuned mother-child emotions (gaze)
	- ***what else spurs dopaminergic neuron creation? can this happen later in life?***
11 p88- woah

12-
"sometimes a couple will avoid focusing on tensions between them and focus on what is wrong with their child to avoid it"(98)
- unequal divisions of emotional labor = depressed women
- - (132) "My eyes, like those of most anyone with adhd, sweep across faces I meet as if of their own volition, seeking everyone else's eyes for signs of contact." WOAH
	- activation of brain circuitry created when I scanned my mother's face seeking contact
- Origins of shame= infant feels as if love/connection has been pulled away
	- internalized shame, frequent apologies
- Boredom=intense unease-aversion to one's own BEING mind, not distracted thought mind
- ***evidence shows new neural circuits can form any stage of development that show you have agency***
- (143) don't give up on people who were born in unfavorable conditions, their brains can grow, they can always grow. 

Healing: integration of emotion with cognition: ***these have been dissonant for me***
- lack of integration = fragmentation
- 
(276) Am I really hurting someone else? Or merely serving my legitimate needs? Can it be both, can both be okay?


Therapy: (276) Am I really hurting someone else? Or merely serving my legitimate needs? Can it be both, can both be okay?
- don't punish yourself for where you find yourself
- "Role of the therapist is a talking mirror in which the patient can see himself more clearly reflected, and reflect on himself."
- (317)"Unless her daughter is well controlled, she can not be accepting of her. Something in the mother tenses up when her daughter tenses up."Enmeshed. Identified. Attached.
- (320) The game is precarious
- "...mask...tensed for fear it will slip."

"I have learned through my own process to go in life cannot be the avoidance of painful feelings. For people like me with ADD and for everyone else emotional pain as a reality. Does not have to exclude joy and capacity to experience the beauty of life. We each for ourselves have to discover the age of wisdom that the thing is not to struggle against pain but to be able to endure it when it is unavoidable." (322)
- feel the feeling, don't hide behind defenses
- love is an action, to nurture another's growth
- ***Learning how to love myself***
	- ***To do so, I must gradually shed defenses I have come to identify as the self, and venture into new territory. ***
		- *Therapy: something tells me, I can't do this without letting the "dark"emotions, memories, times be SEEN and validated. They'll writhe under there, in the land of the unseen, slithering into my subconscious, projecting distortions into my reality. I must invite them all to be seen, heard, and coddled. *
